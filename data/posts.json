		"body": "I found this picture that tells the difference between `abstract class` and `interface`:\r\n\r\n![enter image description here][1]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet's see each comparison practically so we know what it means.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nInterface support multiple inheritance | Abstract class does not support multiple inheritance\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\nIt means you can extend an `interface` with one or more (hence *multiple inheritance*) interfaces like:\r\n\r\n    interface Interface_A { }\r\n    interface Interface_B { }\r\n    interface Interface_C { }\r\n    \r\n    interface MyInterface extends Interface_A, Interface_B, Interface_C { }\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, we are extending `MyInterface` with three other interfaces `Interface_A`, `Interface_A` and `Interface_C`.\r\n\r\nLet's now try to extend an `abstract class`:\r\n\r\n    class Class_A { }\r\n    \r\n    abstract class MyAbstractClass extends Class_A { }\r\n\r\nNo problem there, you CAN extend an abstract class with exactly one class but if you try to add one more:\r\n\r\n    class Class_A { }\r\n    class Class_B { }\r\n    \r\n    abstract class MyAbstractClass extends Class_A, Class_B { }\r\n\r\nThis time PHP would give you strange error without telling you what you are doing wrong:\r\n\r\n`Parse error: syntax error, unexpected ',', expecting '{'`\r\n\r\nI wish PHP would have given message somewhat like (hope PHP gives smarter error messages in future versions):\r\n\r\n`Fatal Error: You cannot extend an abstract class with more than one classes`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nInterface does'n Contains Data Member | Abstract class contains Data Member\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\nBy data members, it means class properties or variables. So you cannot add data members to an interface:\r\n\r\n    interface MyInterface {\r\n        public $foo = null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo in an interface, only method stubs can be provided.\r\n\r\nYou can add data members to an abstract class though, this is valid code of course:\r\n\r\n    abstract class MyAbstractClass {\r\n        public $foo = null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nInterface does'n contains Constructors | Abstract class contains Constructors\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\nIt sounds like this point applies to may be other languages but in PHP an interface CAN have an empty constructor shell:\r\n\r\n    interface MyInterface {\r\n        public function __construct();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nLike other languages, PHP shouldn't have allowed having a constructor inside an interface. But anyways, it doesn't make much sense here and should be avoided anyway.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, an abstract class can contain constructor method:\r\n\r\n    abstract class MyAbstractClass {\r\n        abstract public function __construct();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere constructor is said to be `abstract` and therefore expends child classes to complement for it. However, you can also have common initialization code in constructor of an abstract class too in which case, you would need to remove the `abstract` keyword and provide the body for it:\r\n\r\n    abstract class MyAbstractClass {\r\n        public function __construct() {\r\n             \/\/ initialization code\r\n        };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nAn interface Contains only incomplete member (signature of member) | An abstract class Contains both incomplete (abstract) and complete member\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\nThis simply means an interface can only contain method stubs not their implementation. This is pretty same as second point in the image above. This is why in methods of an interface, they don't have bodies marked with `{ }` braces. So an interface is completely empty shell that enforces some rules that child classes must implement and that's it.\r\n\r\nAbstract classes can have both; empty method definitions as well as full method implementation. Generally empty method stubs are prefixed with `abstract` keyword so that child classes must provide their implementation details. But an abstract class can also contain full method implementation inside it which are generally used for common piece of functionality that each child class may need. For example:\r\n\r\n    abstract class Animal {\r\n        \/\/ child classes must implement this\r\n        abstract function prey();\r\n        \r\n        public function run() {\r\n            echo 'I am running!';\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class Dog extends Animal {\r\n        public function prey() {\r\n            echo 'I killed the cat !';\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    class Cat extends Animal {\r\n        public function prey() {\r\n            echo 'I killed the rat !';\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    $dog = new Dog();\r\n    $cat = new Cat();\r\n    \r\n    $dog->prey(); \/\/ I killed the cat !\r\n    $cat->prey(); \/\/ I killed the rat !\r\n    \r\n    $dog->run(); \/\/ I am running!\r\n    $cat->run(); \/\/ I am running!\r\n\r\nIn above code, we can see that `Animal` class has one `abstract` method called `prey` because each child class (animal) have their own ways of finding prey and a full implemented method called `run` because all animals can run, this doesn't need to be defined in each of child classes. So here `run` method is fully implemented and represents common data that needs to be shared across child classes.\r\n\r\nNotice that other than common fully implemented methods inside an abstract class, you can also have common data members eg variables that need to be shared across child classes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nAn interface cannot have access modifiers by default everything is assumed as public | An abstract class can contain access modifiers for the subs, functions, properties\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\nBy access modifiers, we mean ability to change scoping by using keywords like [`public`, `private` and `protected`][2]. We cannot use these for interfaces but we can use them for everything in abstract classes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nMembers of interface can not be Static | Only Complete Member of abstract class can be Static\r\n<\/pre>\r\n\r\nThis is again possible in PHP (as of now with PHP 5.4) unlike other languages, so you CAN do:\r\n\r\n    interface MyInterface {\r\n        static function foo();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNotice the addition of keyword `static` to mark it as static method.\r\n\r\nFor abstract class, you can have static members as well as those methods that are implemented in the abstract class:\r\n\r\n    abstract class MyAbstractClass {\r\n        public static $foo = null;\r\n        \r\n        public static function foo() {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut you cannot have a method to be both `static` and `abstract`, so you cannot do this, which is common across the languages:\r\n\r\n    abstract class MyAbstractClass {\r\n        public static $foo = null;\r\n        \r\n        abstract static function foo() {} \/\/ error\r\n    }\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, interface and abstract classes are completely different from each other, you cannot interchange them or use one as alternative over the other. Interfaces are completely empty shells that expect child classes to implement everything for them. On the other hand, abstract class can not only contain *common piece of information* by implementing inside them but also expect child classes to fill in the remaining gaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/images\/142937584655328b66dcedc.png\r\n  [2]: http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/4361553\/php-public-private-protected",

		"body": "Often times, you quickly need to test some PHP code. To do so, you create a file, put it in web root folder, write some code in it, open its URL and then you see its output. This is kind of lot of work and I often need a way to quickly test my PHP code. This requirement made me create my own code testing tool, **PHPExecute**.\r\n\r\nPHPExecute is the fastest way to test PHP code. You write the code, hit the execute button, an ajax request is triggered and you see the output fast without page refresh. Here are some of the cool things about it:\r\n\r\n- Very fast way to test your code\r\n- Nice friendly interface\r\n- Code  Highlighting\r\n- Useful PHP, system information panel\r\n- Saving favorite code snippets\r\n- Adding useful classes\r\n- Easy to extend as per your needs\r\n\r\n**Screenshot**\r\n\r\n![enter image description here][1]\r\n\r\n## Extending PHPExecute ##\r\n\r\nThe good thing is that you can download (see below) it, see its source code and extend it however you like according to your needs. For example, you can add classes for testing, performance or any other purpose. One can even integrate bash commands (I am not going into details of that) to make it even more useful tool to work with.\r\n\r\n## Usage Notes ##\r\n\r\n - PHPExecute uses [`eval`][2] function to run the code. It is strongly recommended that you should use that tool for local testing only and not on production server due to security reasons. If you do, you use it on your own risk.\r\n\r\n - In order to save snippets, PHPExecute uses [localStorage][3] feature which is available in latest browsers (and IE9+) only and also it can be around **5MB** in size. This isn\u2019t that ideal if you are going to save a lot of snippets but you can always extend PHPExecute to add database support and save your snippets there.\r\n\r\n - The custom functions that can be used in PHPExecute can be found in **includes\/functions.php** file. You can add any functions in that file that you want to use directly inside PHPExecute. The custom functions can also be seen in **PHP Info > User Defined Functions**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Download**\r\n\r\n[Download PHPExecute at Github][4]\r\n\r\nI hope PHPExecute turns out to be a useful tool for you. Please do share if you add anything to it via comments so that we could know it and integrate ourselves too :)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/images\/1428864689552abeb12a929.gif\r\n  [2]: http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/function.eval.php\r\n  [3]: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Web_Storage\r\n  [4]: https:\/\/github.com\/sarfraznawaz2005\/PHPExecute",

		"body": "JavaScript is [cross-platform][1], cross-browser language; javascript is everywhere; web, [RIA][2] (rich internet applications), [mobile, tablets][3], [animations][4] and even on server with the advent of [node.js][5]. Javascript is the language of the future.\r\n\r\nI started off with jQuery without knowing anything much about javascript because by the time I didn\u2019t find any reason to learn it due to fact that  javascript libraries did everything we needed putting complexities out of the way. Today I realize that I chose the wrong path, a good understanding of javascript language is crucial if you look at the reasons I have mentioned in the very beginning but it is never too late to start again, that\u2019s exactly what I have decided, learning javascript seriously. I am not the only one who has started realizing the power and future of javascript, there are [giants][6] who have started learning it too. If you are also javascript-library-only developer, or even **copy-paster** programmer, [you should really][7] [learn javascript][8] seriously !\r\n\r\nDespite design flaws and bad reputation of the language [as they say][9] and probably rightly so, javascript is popular and language of the choice for those who have gone into deeper [understating][10] [of][11] [it][12]. Javascript language [does][13] [have][14] [bad][15] [parts][16] but its [good parts][17] over-weigh its bad parts and there is always room to avoid bad parts if you know the language right and use it effectively.\r\n\r\nJavascript turns out to be extremely [tricky][18] language, consider:\r\n\r\n    \/\/ Comparison\r\n    '' == '0';    \/\/false\r\n    0 == '';    \/\/ true\r\n    0 =='0';    \/\/ true\r\n     \r\n    \/\/ Type checking\r\n    typeof null;    \/\/ object\r\n     \r\n    \/\/ Scope\r\n    function myFunc() {\r\n      return\r\n      {\r\n        name: 'sarfraz'\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n     \r\n    var f = myFunc();\r\n    console.log(f);    \/\/ undefined\r\n\r\nI did **a lot of research** to find best javascript learning resources. On the journey of my exploration, I came across some of the great resources with a lot of reviews and user feedback.

		"body": "Although there exist **classes** for outputting PHP to browser console such as Google\u2019s **PHP Console** and certain others, I was looking for a way to output PHP to browser console without including those classes in my PHP files or installing any browser plugin to do the same. Currently, I am working on Facebook application development in which you have to commit\/upload the code to check certain output out of PHP unlike offline development where you check the code output before committing it up. This makes Facebook application development a longer process for a developer but you got to live with it because you don\u2019t have a choice.\r\n\r\nAnyways, to speed up the code output checking process a little and rather using `debug_backtrace`, `print_r`, `print`, `echo`, `var_dump`, etc which you need to remove\/comment again, I created a function to get output of PHP on the browser console. One could use `error_log` function but even that makes you go to your log file and then see the output. Of course, browser needs to support\/have the console so that code result is output there. Because IE less than 8 doesn't have console, this won\u2019t work in IE less than 8, though result won\u2019t be affected in it.

		"body": "I like to share my local development workflow which has turned out to be **extremely useful** in that all my projects\u2019 files are **version-ed and on the cloud**. I use **git** to keep my files versioned and **Google Drive** so that I can access my projects anywhere. In this post, I will share really cool stuff that you definitely should consider implementing for your own projects.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t know about git and its benefits, there are numerous compelling reasons why it is useful, you might want to check out:\r\n\r\n- [Introduction To Git][1]\r\n- [The Benefits of Using Git][2]\r\n- [Modern Version Control With Git][3]\r\n- [whygitisbetterthanx.com][4]\r\n\r\nThe benefits of keeping all my files and projects on the cloud like Google Drive should be obvious but if you are still not sure, check out:\r\n\r\n- [Why Move to the Cloud? 10 Benefits of Cloud Computing][5]\r\n- [The Six Key Business Benefits of Google Drive][6]\r\n\r\nAlthough there are many other cloud storage services such as [Microsoft SkyDrive][7], [Dropbox][8], [Box][9], [Bitcasa][10], etc but I chose Google Drive since it gives 10GB of free space which should be enough for my development needs. If that\u2019s not enough for you, you can create another Gmail account and get another 10GB free. You might want to read their usage policies too if you want.  You may also consider using Bitcasa which gives you unlimited space but since it is new, I can\u2019t personally trust it as yet.\r\n\r\n## Installing Google Drive ##\r\n\r\n**Step 1:** [Create a new Gmail account][11] to be used with Google Drive client software. Although you can use your existing account but it is good idea to create a new one used for your projects\u2019 backup only.\r\n\r\n**Step 2:** Download Google Drive from [here][12] or [here][13]. During the installation, you would be asked to specify the folder path which will be synchronized with Google Drive. Make sure that you specify a folder present on any drive other than your OS drive so that even if your system crashes or corrupts, your projects remain intact. For example, I have that folder on path D:\/Google Drive\/\r\n\r\n**Step 3:**  Once installed, run Google Drive software and specify the credentials of your newly created Gmail account.\r\n\r\n## Using Google Drive with WAMP\/XAMPP ##\r\n\r\nNow that we\u2019ve setup google drive, it is time to setup document root to google drive folder and create virtual host. This would allow you to run your local projects through WAMP\/XAMPP from google drive folder. The reason why we do this is that since google drive folder will be sync by google drive software, any project we put in that folder will automatically be uploaded in your google drive account.\r\n\r\n> **Note:** I am using XAMPP but if you are using WAMP, some settings or file paths might be different, you should consider reading its\r\n> documentation.\r\n\r\n**Step 1:** Inside your google drive folder, create a new folder named **webroot** making whole path **X:\\Google Drive\\webroot** where **X** represents your drive letter.\r\n\r\n**Step 2:** Assuming you have specified google drive folder to be  **D:\/Google Drive\/**, open **httpd.conf** (normally located at **apache\\conf** folder) file in notepad or other text editor and find the line **Include \u201cconf\/extra\/httpd-vhosts.conf\u201d**. If there is a hash (#) before that line, remove it. Now find the line with **<Directory \/>** and you should see something similar to:\r\n\r\n    <Directory \/>\r\n       AllowOverride none\r\n       Require all denied\r\n    <\/Directory>\r\n\r\nChange **Require all denied**  to **Require all granted**\r\n\r\nOr if you see something like:\r\n\r\n    <Directory \/>\r\n        Options FollowSymLinks\r\n        AllowOverride None\r\n        Order deny,allow\r\n        Deny from all\r\n    <\/Directory>\r\n\r\nChange it to:\r\n\r\n    <Directory \/>\r\n        ........\r\n        Allow from all\r\n    <\/Directory>\r\n\r\nNow come to bottom of the file and add:\r\n\r\n    <Directory \"D:\\Google Drive\\webroot\">\r\n      Options Indexes MultiViews\r\n      Order Allow,Deny\r\n      Allow from all\r\n    <\/Directory>\r\n\r\nSave the file and close it.\r\n\r\n**Step 3:** Open **httpd-vhosts.conf** (normally located at **apache\\conf\\extra** folder) and add these lines at the end of it:\r\n\r\n    <VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>\r\n        DocumentRoot \"D:\/Google Drive\/webroot\"\r\n        ServerName gdroot.loc\r\n        ServerAlias gdroot.loc\r\n        ErrorLog \"D:\/Google Drive\/webroot\/logs\/error.log\"\r\n        CustomLog \"D:\/Google Drive\/webroot\/logs\/access.log\" combined\r\n    <\/VirtualHost>\r\n\r\nSave the file and close it. Notice that we have specified **gdroot.loc** as address which actually means google drive root (**.loc** signals that it is local folder) which actually maps to your google drive webroot folder eg **D:\/Google Drive\/webroot**. Notice that you could name it anything you want like **mycoolwebsite.com, yourname.com**, etc but of course that is local folder running from your own computer.\r\n\r\n**Step 4:** Open **hosts** file in notepad or other text editor located at **X:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc** where **X** stands for drive letter where your OS is installed. At the end of that file add this line assuming you specified URL in above step as **gdroot.loc**:\r\n\r\n    127.0.0.1       gdroot.loc\r\n\r\nOr if you also use port to access your LAMP\/XAMPP URLs, specify that as well:\r\n\r\n    127.0.0.1:PORT_NUMBER_HERE       gdroot.loc\r\n\r\n> **Note:** If you can\u2019t edit hosts file, you need to have file owner permission, search on Google how to do that.\r\n\r\nRestart apache and access the new url by typing **gdroot.loc** in your browser. You should see screen similar to when you go to http:\/\/localhost.\r\n\r\nCongratulations ! you have a nice workflow now. You can now put all your existing our new projects inside your new document root which was assumed to be located at **D:\\Google Drive\\webroot** and now all your projects are sync with google drive and automatically uploaded to your google account which you can access anywhere. For example, you can now access your projects at office or any other computer by installing google drive client software  there and telling it sync\/download your webroot folder. Your projects are now always there and backed up on the cloud :)\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s take cool stuff one step further by using **git** so that our projects file are also **version-ed**. If you don\u2019t know much about git and its benefits consider reading links posted above or below in the **Git Resources** section.\r\n\r\n## Using Git with a Central Repository ##\r\n\r\nCreating and using central repository is especially useful in a team. If you just want to keep your projects version-ed and are the only developer working on a project, the normal flow is (unless you track your project to remote host such as [github][14]):\r\n\r\n- modify files\r\n- commit your changes\r\n- repeat\r\n\r\nSo essentially you can skip this section if you just want to version your project files and are only developer working on a project.\r\n\r\n**Step 1:** Download msysgit from [here][15], choose first link from there. Install it with default settings.\r\n\r\n**Step 2:** Go to your google drive folder (**D:\\Google Drive\\**) and create a new folder there named **central.git**\r\n\r\n**Step 3:** Right click on newly created folder and choose **Git Bash Here** and type: \r\n\r\n    git init \u2013bare\r\n\r\n**Step 4:** Create a test project folder named **myproject** inside your normal WAMP\/XAMPP webroot\/htdocs folder or google drive webroot folder mentioned above (Although you can git-manage any folder anywhere on the drive but naturally we want to git-manage projects that we run from webroot\/htdocs folder).\r\n\r\n**Step 5:** Right click on newly created folder, choose **Git Bash Here** and issue these commands one by one:\r\n\r\n    git init\r\n    git remote add central \/e\/Google\\ Drive\/central.git\/\r\n    git push --all central\r\n    git push --set-upstream-to central master\r\n\r\nGreat! now we\u2019ve setup central repository for all our git-managed projects and we can commit, push, fetch all changes from that central repository. For any new repository, you can now issue commands like:\r\n\r\n    git clone \/e\/Google\\ Drive\/central.git\/\r\n    git fetch \/e\/Google\\ Drive\/central.git\/\r\n    git push central\r\n    and so on\r\n\r\nThat's it.\r\n\r\n## Git Resources ##\r\n\r\n- [Introduction To Git][16]\r\n- [Git for beginners: The definitive practical guide][17]\r\n- [Easy Version Control with Git][18]\r\n- [Pro Git Book][19]\r\n- [Git Reference][20]\r\n- [and more][21]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http:\/\/learn.github.com\/p\/intro.html\r\n  [2]: http:\/\/www.gitology.com\/chapter\/benefits-of-using-git\r\n  [3]: http:\/\/coding.smashingmagazine.com\/2011\/07\/26\/modern-version-control-with-git-series\/\r\n  [4]: http:\/\/whygitisbetterthanx.com\/#svn\r\n  [5]: http:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/uk\/socialsuccess\/cloud-computing\/why-move-to-cloud-10-benefits-cloud-computing.jsp\r\n  [6]: http:\/\/www.go-oodles.com\/index.php\/2012\/08\/the-six-key-business-benefits-of-google-drive\/\r\n  [7]: https:\/\/skydrive.live.com\/\r\n  [8]: https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/\r\n  [9]: https:\/\/www.box.com\/\r\n  [10]: http:\/\/www.bitcasa.com\/\r\n  [11]: https:\/\/mail.google.com\/\r\n  [12]: https:\/\/tools.google.com\/dlpage\/drive\r\n  [13]: http:\/\/filehippo.com\/download_google_drive\/\r\n  [14]: http:\/\/github.com\/\r\n  [15]: http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/msysgit\/downloads\/list\r\n  [16]: http:\/\/learn.github.com\/p\/intro.html\r\n  [17]: http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/315911\/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide\r\n  [18]: http:\/\/net.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/other\/easy-version-control-with-git\/\r\n  [19]: http:\/\/git-scm.com\/book\r\n  [20]: http:\/\/gitref.org\/\r\n  [21]: http:\/\/net.tutsplus.com\/?s=git",
