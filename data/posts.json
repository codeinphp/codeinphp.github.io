		"body": "<p>In the <a href=\"https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/post\/welcome.html\">last post<\/a>, I had mentioned about BloggerCMS which is used to build this very blog. BloggerCMS is dead simple CMS that can be used to create fully functional static blogs. Although there are <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/pinceladasdaweb\/Static-Site-Generators#php\">quite some static site generators<\/a> out there but I created BloggerCMS because I was missing these features in any of those static site generators:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Web interface that allows me to create blog posts, add pages and more instead of writing blog posts manually in bunch of different text files<\/li>\n<li>Markdown editor with live preview feature so that I don't have to type Markdown syntax myself<\/li>\n<li>I needed a true blog generator instead of generic\/advanced site generator<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Those three things are the driving force why I created BloggerCMS. Here is complete list of features of BloggerCMS as of now:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Graphical User Interface<\/strong> - manage your site via a browser<\/li>\n<li><strong>File-based<\/strong> - no database required<\/li>\n<li><strong>Truly Static<\/strong> - no server-side languages needed<\/li>\n<li><strong>Portability<\/strong> - copy, move, backup or version control your site easily<\/li>\n<li><strong>Integrated Markdown Editor<\/strong> - no need to know Markdown<\/li>\n<li><strong>Built-in Images Manager<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Disqus Commenting System<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Search Posts Feature<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Pagination<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Responsive Layout<\/strong> - get started easily with the included responsive layout<\/li>\n<li><strong>RSS Support<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Sitemap Support<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Google Analytics<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Code Highlight Support<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Tags Cloud Support<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Social Follow Section<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Categories Section<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Archives Section<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To know more about BloggerCMS, head over to <a href=\"https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\">it's blog<\/a> or see <a href=\"https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\/post\/introducing-bloggercms.html\">introductory post<\/a>.<\/p>",

Previously I used to blog on wordpress <a href=\"http:\/\/sarfraznawaz.wordpress.com\">here<\/a> but I switched to github pages because I really wanted to have static blog with free hosting and ability to write up quick posts using <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Markdown\">Markdown<\/a> syntax. In the <a href=\"https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/post\/bloggercms-an-static-blog-generator-cms.html\">next post<\/a>, I will write about <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/bloggercms.github.io\">BloggerCMS<\/a><\/strong>, a CMS I have made that helps create static blogs. This blog has also been generated via BloggerCMS :)<\/p>\n<p>On this blog, I intend to write my ideas mainly about PHP as well as other related web development technologies. <\/p>\n<p><em>Stay tuned :)<\/em><\/p>",
