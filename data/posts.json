		"body": "In the [last][1] post, I had mentioned about BloggerCMS which is used to build this very blog. BloggerCMS is dead simple CMS that can be used to create fully functional static blogs. Although there are [quite some static site generators][2] out there but I created BloggerCMS because I was missing these features in any of those static site generators:\r\n\r\n - Web interface that allows me to create blog posts, add pages and more instead of writing blog posts manually in bunch of different text files\r\n - Markdown editor with live preview feature so that I don't have to type Markdown syntax myself\r\n - I needed a true blog generator instead of generic\/advanced site generator\r\n\r\nThose three things are the driving force why I created BloggerCMS. Here is complete list of features of BloggerCMS as of now:\r\n\r\n - **Graphical User Interface** - manage your site via a browser\r\n - **File-based** - no database required\r\n - **Truly Static** - no server-side languages needed\r\n - **Portability** - copy, move, backup or version control your site easily\r\n - **Integrated Markdown Editor** - no need to know Markdown\r\n - **Built-in Images Manager**\r\n - **Disqus Commenting System**\r\n - **Search Posts Feature**\r\n - **Responsive Layout** - get started easily with the included responsive layout\r\n - **RSS Support**\r\n - **Sitemap Support**\r\n - **Code Highlight Support**\r\n - **Tags Cloud Support**\r\n - **Social Follow Section**\r\n - **Categories Section**\r\n - **Archives Section**\r\n\r\nTo know more about BloggerCMS, head over to [it's blog][3] or see [introductory post][4].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/post\/welcome.html\r\n  [2]: https:\/\/github.com\/pinceladasdaweb\/Static-Site-Generators#php\r\n  [3]: https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/bloggercms-demo\r\n  [4]: https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/bloggercms-demo\/post\/introducing-bloggercms.html",

Previously I used to blog on wordpress [here][2] but I switched to github pages because I really wanted to have static blog with free hosting and ability to write up quick posts using [Markdown][3] syntax. In the [next post][4], I will write about **[BloggerCMS][5]**, a CMS I have made that helps create static blogs. This blog has also been generated via BloggerCMS :)\r\n\r\nOn this blog, I intend to write my ideas mainly about PHP as well as other related web development technologies. \r\n\r\n*Stay tuned :)*\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https:\/\/pages.github.com\/\r\n  [2]: http:\/\/sarfraznawaz.wordpress.com\r\n  [3]: http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Markdown\r\n  [4]: https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/post\/bloggercms-an-static-blog-creator-cms.html\r\n  [5]: https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/bloggercms-demo\/",
