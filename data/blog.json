			"category": "PHP",
			"body": "<p>Often times, you quickly need to test some PHP code. To do so, you create a file, put it in web root folder, write some code in it, open its URL and then you see its output. This is kind of lot of work and I often need a way to quickly test my PHP code. This requirement made me create my own code testing tool, <strong>PHPExecute<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>PHPExecute is the fastest way to test PHP code. You write the code, hit the execute button, an ajax request is triggered and you see the output fast without page refresh. Here are some of the cool things about it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very fast way to test your code<\/li>\n<li>Nice friendly interface<\/li>\n<li>Code  Highlighting<\/li>\n<li>Useful PHP, system information panel<\/li>\n<li>Saving favorite code snippets<\/li>\n<li>Adding useful classes<\/li>\n<li>Easy to extend as per your needs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Screenshot<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/images\/1428864689552abeb12a929.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Extending PHPExecute<\/h2>\n<p>The good thing is that you can download (see below) it, see its source code and extend it however you like according to your needs. For example, you can add classes for testing, performance or any other purpose. One can even integrate bash commands (I am not going into details of that) to make it even more useful tool to work with.<\/p>\n<h2>Usage Notes<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>PHPExecute uses <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/function.eval.php\"><code>eval<\/code><\/a> function to run the code. It is strongly recommended that you should use that tool for local testing only and not on production server due to security reasons. If you do, you use it on your own risk.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In order to save snippets, PHPExecute uses <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Web_Storage\">localStorage<\/a> feature which is available in latest browsers (and IE9+) only and also it can be around <strong>5MB<\/strong> in size. This isn\u2019t that ideal if you are going to save a lot of snippets but you can always extend PHPExecute to add database support and save your snippets there.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>The custom functions that can be used in PHPExecute can be found in <strong>includes\/functions.php<\/strong> file. You can add any functions in that file that you want to use directly inside PHPExecute. The custom functions can also be seen in <strong>PHP Info &gt; User Defined Functions<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Download<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sarfraznawaz2005\/PHPExecute\">Download PHPExecute at Github<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I hope PHPExecute turns out to be a useful tool for you. Please do share if you add anything to it via comments so that we could know it and integrate ourselves too :)<\/p>",

			"body": "<p>Although there exist <strong>classes<\/strong> for outputting PHP to browser console such as Google\u2019s <strong>PHP Console<\/strong> and certain others, I was looking for a way to output PHP to browser console without including those classes in my PHP files or installing any browser plugin to do the same. Currently, I am working on Facebook application development in which you have to commit\/upload the code to check certain output out of PHP unlike offline development where you check the code output before committing it up. This makes Facebook application development a longer process for a developer but you got to live with it because you don\u2019t have a choice.<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, to speed up the code output checking process a little and rather using <code>debug_backtrace<\/code>, <code>print_r<\/code>, <code>print<\/code>, <code>echo<\/code>, <code>var_dump<\/code>, etc which you need to remove\/comment again, I created a function to get output of PHP on the browser console. One could use <code>error_log<\/code> function but even that makes you go to your log file and then see the output. Of course, browser needs to support\/have the console so that code result is output there. Because IE less than 8 doesn't have console, this won\u2019t work in IE less than 8, though result won\u2019t be affected in it. Notice that you can see console in IE=&gt;8 by pressing <kbd>F12<\/kbd> key and then going to <strong>Script<\/strong> tab where you need to make sure <strong>Console<\/strong> tab is selected on the right side.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the function:<\/p>\n<pre><code> \/**\n * Logs messages\/variables\/data to browser console from within php\n *\n * @param $name: message to be shown for optional data\/vars\n * @param $data: variable (scalar\/mixed) arrays\/objects, etc to be logged\n * @param $jsEval: whether to apply JS eval() to arrays\/objects\n *\n * @return none\n * @author Sarfraz\n *\/\n function logConsole($name, $data = NULL, $jsEval = FALSE)\n {\n      if (! $name) return false;\n\n      $isevaled = false;\n      $type = ($data || gettype($data)) ?

I have been using this function successfully so far, please let me know your ideas if any on how to improve this piece of code further. <\/p>",

I use <strong>git<\/strong> to keep my files versioned and <strong>Google Drive<\/strong> so that I can access my projects anywhere. In this post, I will share really cool stuff that you definitely should consider implementing for your own projects.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know about git and its benefits, there are numerous compelling reasons why it is useful, you might want to check out:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/learn.github.com\/p\/intro.html\">Introduction To Git<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gitology.com\/chapter\/benefits-of-using-git\">The Benefits of Using Git<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/coding.smashingmagazine.com\/2011\/07\/26\/modern-version-control-with-git-series\/\">Modern Version Control With Git<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/whygitisbetterthanx.com\/#svn\">whygitisbetterthanx.com<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The benefits of keeping all my files and projects on the cloud like Google Drive should be obvious but if you are still not sure, check out:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/uk\/socialsuccess\/cloud-computing\/why-move-to-cloud-10-benefits-cloud-computing.jsp\">Why Move to the Cloud? 10 Benefits of Cloud Computing<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.go-oodles.com\/index.php\/2012\/08\/the-six-key-business-benefits-of-google-drive\/\">The Six Key Business Benefits of Google Drive<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Although there are many other cloud storage services such as <a href=\"https:\/\/skydrive.live.com\/\">Microsoft SkyDrive<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/\">Dropbox<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.box.com\/\">Box<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bitcasa.com\/\">Bitcasa<\/a>, etc but I chose Google Drive since it gives 10GB of free space which should be enough for my development needs. If that\u2019s not enough for you, you can create another Gmail account and get another 10GB free. You might want to read their usage policies too if you want.  You may also consider using Bitcasa which gives you unlimited space but since it is new, I can\u2019t personally trust it as yet.<\/p>\n<h2>Installing Google Drive<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/mail.google.com\/\">Create a new Gmail account<\/a> to be used with Google Drive client software. Although you can use your existing account but it is good idea to create a new one used for your projects\u2019 backup only.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Download Google Drive from <a href=\"https:\/\/tools.google.com\/dlpage\/drive\">here<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/filehippo.com\/download_google_drive\/\">here<\/a>. During the installation, you would be asked to specify the folder path which will be synchronized with Google Drive. Make sure that you specify a folder present on any drive other than your OS drive so that even if your system crashes or corrupts, your projects remain intact. For example, I have that folder on path D:\/Google Drive\/<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:<\/strong>  Once installed, run Google Drive software and specify the credentials of your newly created Gmail account.<\/p>\n<h2>Using Google Drive with WAMP\/XAMPP<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve setup google drive, it is time to setup document root to google drive folder and create virtual host. This would allow you to run your local projects through WAMP\/XAMPP from google drive folder. The reason why we do this is that since google drive folder will be sync by google drive software, any project we put in that folder will automatically be uploaded in your google drive account.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> I am using XAMPP but if you are using WAMP, some settings or file paths might be different, you should consider reading its\ndocumentation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Inside your google drive folder, create a new folder named <strong>webroot<\/strong> making whole path <strong>X:\\Google Drive\\webroot<\/strong> where <strong>X<\/strong> represents your drive letter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Assuming you have specified google drive folder to be  <strong>D:\/Google Drive\/<\/strong>, open <strong>httpd.conf<\/strong> (normally located at <strong>apache\\conf<\/strong> folder) file in notepad or other text editor and find the line <strong>Include \u201cconf\/extra\/httpd-vhosts.conf\u201d<\/strong>. If there is a hash (#) before that line, remove it. Now find the line with <strong><Directory \/><\/strong> and you should see something similar to:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory \/&gt;\n   AllowOverride none\n   Require all denied\n&lt;\/Directory&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Change <strong>Require all denied<\/strong>  to <strong>Require all granted<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Or if you see something like:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory \/&gt;\n    Options FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride None\n    Order deny,allow\n    Deny from all\n&lt;\/Directory&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Change it to:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory \/&gt;\n    ........\n    Allow from all\n&lt;\/Directory&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now come to bottom of the file and add:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory \"D:\\Google Drive\\webroot\"&gt;\n  Options Indexes MultiViews\n  Order Allow,Deny\n  Allow from all\n&lt;\/Directory&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Save the file and close it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Open <strong>httpd-vhosts.conf<\/strong> (normally located at <strong>apache\\conf\\extra<\/strong> folder) and add these lines at the end of it:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80&gt;\n    DocumentRoot \"D:\/Google Drive\/webroot\"\n    ServerName gdroot.loc\n    ServerAlias gdroot.loc\n    ErrorLog \"D:\/Google Drive\/webroot\/logs\/error.log\"\n    CustomLog \"D:\/Google Drive\/webroot\/logs\/access.log\" combined\n&lt;\/VirtualHost&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Save the file and close it. Notice that we have specified <strong>gdroot.loc<\/strong> as address which actually means google drive root (<strong>.loc<\/strong> signals that it is local folder) which actually maps to your google drive webroot folder eg <strong>D:\/Google Drive\/webroot<\/strong>. Notice that you could name it anything you want like <strong>mycoolwebsite.com, yourname.com<\/strong>, etc but of course that is local folder running from your own computer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 4:<\/strong> Open <strong>hosts<\/strong> file in notepad or other text editor located at <strong>X:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc<\/strong> where <strong>X<\/strong> stands for drive letter where your OS is installed. At the end of that file add this line assuming you specified URL in above step as <strong>gdroot.loc<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<pre><code>127.0.0.1       gdroot.loc<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Or if you also use port to access your LAMP\/XAMPP URLs, specify that as well:<\/p>\n<pre><code>127.0.0.1:PORT_NUMBER_HERE       gdroot.loc<\/code><\/pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> If you can\u2019t edit hosts file, you need to have file owner permission, search on Google how to do that.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Restart apache and access the new url by typing <strong>gdroot.loc<\/strong> in your browser. You should see screen similar to when you go to <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\">http:\/\/localhost<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations ! you have a nice workflow now. You can now put all your existing our new projects inside your new document root which was assumed to be located at <strong>D:\\Google Drive\\webroot<\/strong> and now all your projects are sync with google drive and automatically uploaded to your google account which you can access anywhere. For example, you can now access your projects at office or any other computer by installing google drive client software  there and telling it sync\/download your webroot folder. Your projects are now always there and backed up on the cloud :)<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take cool stuff one step further by using <strong>git<\/strong> so that our projects file are also <strong>version-ed<\/strong>. If you don\u2019t know much about git and its benefits consider reading links posted above or below in the <strong>Git Resources<\/strong> section.<\/p>\n<h2>Using Git with a Central Repository<\/h2>\n<p>Creating and using central repository is especially useful in a team.

Install it with default settings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Go to your google drive folder (<strong>D:\\Google Drive\\<\/strong>) and create a new folder there named <strong>central.git<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Right click on newly created folder and choose <strong>Git Bash Here<\/strong> and type: <\/p>\n<pre><code>git init \u2013bare<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>Step 4:<\/strong> Create a test project folder named <strong>myproject<\/strong> inside your normal WAMP\/XAMPP webroot\/htdocs folder or google drive webroot folder mentioned above (Although you can git-manage any folder anywhere on the drive but naturally we want to git-manage projects that we run from webroot\/htdocs folder).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 5:<\/strong> Right click on newly created folder, choose <strong>Git Bash Here<\/strong> and issue these commands one by one:<\/p>\n<pre><code>git init\ngit remote add central \/e\/Google\\ Drive\/central.git\/\ngit push --all central\ngit push --set-upstream-to central master<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Great! now we\u2019ve setup central repository for all our git-managed projects and we can commit, push, fetch all changes from that central repository. For any new repository, you can now issue commands like:<\/p>\n<pre><code>git clone \/e\/Google\\ Drive\/central.git\/\ngit fetch \/e\/Google\\ Drive\/central.git\/\ngit push central\nand so on<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>That's it.<\/p>\n<h2>Git Resources<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/learn.github.com\/p\/intro.html\">Introduction To Git<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/315911\/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide\">Git for beginners: The definitive practical guide<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/net.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/other\/easy-version-control-with-git\/\">Easy Version Control with Git<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/git-scm.com\/book\">Pro Git Book<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/gitref.org\/\">Git Reference<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/net.tutsplus.com\/?s=git\">and more<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>",

			"body": "<p>Often times, you quickly need to test some PHP code. To do so, you create a file, put it in web root folder, write some code in it, open its URL and then you see its output. This is kind of lot of work and I often need a way to quickly test my PHP code. This requirement made me create my own code testing tool, <strong>PHPExecute<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>PHPExecute is the fastest way to test PHP code. You write the code, hit the execute button, an ajax request is triggered and you see the output fast without page refresh. Here are some of the cool things about it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very fast way to test your code<\/li>\n<li>Nice friendly interface<\/li>\n<li>Code  Highlighting<\/li>\n<li>Useful PHP, system information panel<\/li>\n<li>Saving favorite code snippets<\/li>\n<li>Adding useful classes<\/li>\n<li>Easy to extend as per your needs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Screenshot<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/images\/1428864689552abeb12a929.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Extending PHPExecute<\/h2>\n<p>The good thing is that you can download (see below) it, see its source code and extend it however you like according to your needs. For example, you can add classes for testing, performance or any other purpose. One can even integrate bash commands (I am not going into details of that) to make it even more useful tool to work with.<\/p>\n<h2>Usage Notes<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>PHPExecute uses <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/function.eval.php\"><code>eval<\/code><\/a> function to run the code. It is strongly recommended that you should use that tool for local testing only and not on production server due to security reasons. If you do, you use it on your own risk.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In order to save snippets, PHPExecute uses <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Web_Storage\">localStorage<\/a> feature which is available in latest browsers (and IE9+) only and also it can be around <strong>5MB<\/strong> in size. This isn\u2019t that ideal if you are going to save a lot of snippets but you can always extend PHPExecute to add database support and save your snippets there.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>The custom functions that can be used in PHPExecute can be found in <strong>includes\/functions.php<\/strong> file. You can add any functions in that file that you want to use directly inside PHPExecute. The custom functions can also be seen in <strong>PHP Info &gt; User Defined Functions<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Download<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sarfraznawaz2005\/PHPExecute\">Download PHPExecute at Github<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I hope PHPExecute turns out to be a useful tool for you. Please do share if you add anything to it via comments so that we could know it and integrate ourselves too :)<\/p>",

Currently, I am working on Facebook application development in which you have to commit\/upload the code to check certain output out of PHP unlike offline development where you check the code output before committing it up. This makes Facebook application development a longer process for a developer but you got to live with it because you don\u2019t have a choice.<\/p>\n<p>Anyways, to speed up the code output checking process a little and rather using <code>debug_backtrace<\/code>, <code>print_r<\/code>, <code>print<\/code>, <code>echo<\/code>, <code>var_dump<\/code>, etc which you need to remove\/comment again, I created a function to get output of PHP on the browser console. One could use <code>error_log<\/code> function but even that makes you go to your log file and then see the output. Of course, browser needs to support\/have the console so that code result is output there. Because IE less than 8 doesn't have console, this won\u2019t work in IE less than 8, though result won\u2019t be affected in it. Notice that you can see console in IE=&gt;8 by pressing <kbd>F12<\/kbd> key and then going to <strong>Script<\/strong> tab where you need to make sure <strong>Console<\/strong> tab is selected on the right side.<\/p>\n<p>Here is the function:<\/p>\n<pre><code> \/**\n * Logs messages\/variables\/data to browser console from within php\n *\n * @param $name: message to be shown for optional data\/vars\n * @param $data: variable (scalar\/mixed) arrays\/objects, etc to be logged\n * @param $jsEval: whether to apply JS eval() to arrays\/objects\n *\n * @return none\n * @author Sarfraz\n *\/\n function logConsole($name, $data = NULL, $jsEval = FALSE)\n {\n      if (! $name) return false;\n\n      $isevaled = false;\n      $type = ($data || gettype($data)) ?

In this post, I will share really cool stuff that you definitely should consider implementing for your own projects.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know about git and its benefits, there are numerous compelling reasons why it is useful, you might want to check out:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/learn.github.com\/p\/intro.html\">Introduction To Git<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gitology.com\/chapter\/benefits-of-using-git\">The Benefits of Using Git<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/coding.smashingmagazine.com\/2011\/07\/26\/modern-version-control-with-git-series\/\">Modern Version Control With Git<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/whygitisbetterthanx.com\/#svn\">whygitisbetterthanx.com<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The benefits of keeping all my files and projects on the cloud like Google Drive should be obvious but if you are still not sure, check out:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.salesforce.com\/uk\/socialsuccess\/cloud-computing\/why-move-to-cloud-10-benefits-cloud-computing.jsp\">Why Move to the Cloud? 10 Benefits of Cloud Computing<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.go-oodles.com\/index.php\/2012\/08\/the-six-key-business-benefits-of-google-drive\/\">The Six Key Business Benefits of Google Drive<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Although there are many other cloud storage services such as <a href=\"https:\/\/skydrive.live.com\/\">Microsoft SkyDrive<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dropbox.com\/\">Dropbox<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.box.com\/\">Box<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bitcasa.com\/\">Bitcasa<\/a>, etc but I chose Google Drive since it gives 10GB of free space which should be enough for my development needs. If that\u2019s not enough for you, you can create another Gmail account and get another 10GB free. You might want to read their usage policies too if you want.  You may also consider using Bitcasa which gives you unlimited space but since it is new, I can\u2019t personally trust it as yet.<\/p>\n<h2>Installing Google Drive<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/mail.google.com\/\">Create a new Gmail account<\/a> to be used with Google Drive client software. Although you can use your existing account but it is good idea to create a new one used for your projects\u2019 backup only.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Download Google Drive from <a href=\"https:\/\/tools.google.com\/dlpage\/drive\">here<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/filehippo.com\/download_google_drive\/\">here<\/a>. During the installation, you would be asked to specify the folder path which will be synchronized with Google Drive. Make sure that you specify a folder present on any drive other than your OS drive so that even if your system crashes or corrupts, your projects remain intact. For example, I have that folder on path D:\/Google Drive\/<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:<\/strong>  Once installed, run Google Drive software and specify the credentials of your newly created Gmail account.<\/p>\n<h2>Using Google Drive with WAMP\/XAMPP<\/h2>\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve setup google drive, it is time to setup document root to google drive folder and create virtual host. This would allow you to run your local projects through WAMP\/XAMPP from google drive folder. The reason why we do this is that since google drive folder will be sync by google drive software, any project we put in that folder will automatically be uploaded in your google drive account.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> I am using XAMPP but if you are using WAMP, some settings or file paths might be different, you should consider reading its\ndocumentation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Inside your google drive folder, create a new folder named <strong>webroot<\/strong> making whole path <strong>X:\\Google Drive\\webroot<\/strong> where <strong>X<\/strong> represents your drive letter.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Assuming you have specified google drive folder to be  <strong>D:\/Google Drive\/<\/strong>, open <strong>httpd.conf<\/strong> (normally located at <strong>apache\\conf<\/strong> folder) file in notepad or other text editor and find the line <strong>Include \u201cconf\/extra\/httpd-vhosts.conf\u201d<\/strong>. If there is a hash (#) before that line, remove it. Now find the line with <strong><Directory \/><\/strong> and you should see something similar to:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory \/&gt;\n   AllowOverride none\n   Require all denied\n&lt;\/Directory&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Change <strong>Require all denied<\/strong>  to <strong>Require all granted<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Or if you see something like:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory \/&gt;\n    Options FollowSymLinks\n    AllowOverride None\n    Order deny,allow\n    Deny from all\n&lt;\/Directory&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Change it to:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory \/&gt;\n    ........\n    Allow from all\n&lt;\/Directory&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now come to bottom of the file and add:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;Directory \"D:\\Google Drive\\webroot\"&gt;\n  Options Indexes MultiViews\n  Order Allow,Deny\n  Allow from all\n&lt;\/Directory&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Save the file and close it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Open <strong>httpd-vhosts.conf<\/strong> (normally located at <strong>apache\\conf\\extra<\/strong> folder) and add these lines at the end of it:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80&gt;\n    DocumentRoot \"D:\/Google Drive\/webroot\"\n    ServerName gdroot.loc\n    ServerAlias gdroot.loc\n    ErrorLog \"D:\/Google Drive\/webroot\/logs\/error.log\"\n    CustomLog \"D:\/Google Drive\/webroot\/logs\/access.log\" combined\n&lt;\/VirtualHost&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Save the file and close it. Notice that we have specified <strong>gdroot.loc<\/strong> as address which actually means google drive root (<strong>.loc<\/strong> signals that it is local folder) which actually maps to your google drive webroot folder eg <strong>D:\/Google Drive\/webroot<\/strong>. Notice that you could name it anything you want like <strong>mycoolwebsite.com, yourname.com<\/strong>, etc but of course that is local folder running from your own computer.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 4:<\/strong> Open <strong>hosts<\/strong> file in notepad or other text editor located at <strong>X:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc<\/strong> where <strong>X<\/strong> stands for drive letter where your OS is installed. At the end of that file add this line assuming you specified URL in above step as <strong>gdroot.loc<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<pre><code>127.0.0.1       gdroot.loc<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Or if you also use port to access your LAMP\/XAMPP URLs, specify that as well:<\/p>\n<pre><code>127.0.0.1:PORT_NUMBER_HERE       gdroot.loc<\/code><\/pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> If you can\u2019t edit hosts file, you need to have file owner permission, search on Google how to do that.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>Restart apache and access the new url by typing <strong>gdroot.loc<\/strong> in your browser. You should see screen similar to when you go to <a href=\"http:\/\/localhost\">http:\/\/localhost<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Congratulations ! you have a nice workflow now. You can now put all your existing our new projects inside your new document root which was assumed to be located at <strong>D:\\Google Drive\\webroot<\/strong> and now all your projects are sync with google drive and automatically uploaded to your google account which you can access anywhere. For example, you can now access your projects at office or any other computer by installing google drive client software  there and telling it sync\/download your webroot folder. Your projects are now always there and backed up on the cloud :)<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take cool stuff one step further by using <strong>git<\/strong> so that our projects file are also <strong>version-ed<\/strong>. If you don\u2019t know much about git and its benefits consider reading links posted above or below in the <strong>Git Resources<\/strong> section.<\/p>\n<h2>Using Git with a Central Repository<\/h2>\n<p>Creating and using central repository is especially useful in a team. If you just want to keep your projects version-ed and are the only developer working on a project, the normal flow is (unless you track your project to remote host such as <a href=\"http:\/\/github.com\/\">github<\/a>):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>modify files<\/li>\n<li>commit your changes<\/li>\n<li>repeat<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>So essentially you can skip this section if you just want to version your project files and are only developer working on a project.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 1:<\/strong> Download msysgit from <a href=\"http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/msysgit\/downloads\/list\">here<\/a>, choose first link from there. Install it with default settings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 2:<\/strong> Go to your google drive folder (<strong>D:\\Google Drive\\<\/strong>) and create a new folder there named <strong>central.git<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 3:<\/strong> Right click on newly created folder and choose <strong>Git Bash Here<\/strong> and type: <\/p>\n<pre><code>git init \u2013bare<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>Step 4:<\/strong> Create a test project folder named <strong>myproject<\/strong> inside your normal WAMP\/XAMPP webroot\/htdocs folder or google drive webroot folder mentioned above (Although you can git-manage any folder anywhere on the drive but naturally we want to git-manage projects that we run from webroot\/htdocs folder).<\/p>\n<p><strong>Step 5:<\/strong> Right click on newly created folder, choose <strong>Git Bash Here<\/strong> and issue these commands one by one:<\/p>\n<pre><code>git init\ngit remote add central \/e\/Google\\ Drive\/central.git\/\ngit push --all central\ngit push --set-upstream-to central master<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Great! now we\u2019ve setup central repository for all our git-managed projects and we can commit, push, fetch all changes from that central repository. For any new repository, you can now issue commands like:<\/p>\n<pre><code>git clone \/e\/Google\\ Drive\/central.git\/\ngit fetch \/e\/Google\\ Drive\/central.git\/\ngit push central\nand so on<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>That's it.<\/p>\n<h2>Git Resources<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/learn.github.com\/p\/intro.html\">Introduction To Git<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/315911\/git-for-beginners-the-definitive-practical-guide\">Git for beginners: The definitive practical guide<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/net.tutsplus.com\/tutorials\/other\/easy-version-control-with-git\/\">Easy Version Control with Git<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/git-scm.com\/book\">Pro Git Book<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/gitref.org\/\">Git Reference<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/net.tutsplus.com\/?s=git\">and more<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>",

			"category": "PHP",
			"body": "<p>Often times, you quickly need to test some PHP code. To do so, you create a file, put it in web root folder, write some code in it, open its URL and then you see its output. This is kind of lot of work and I often need a way to quickly test my PHP code. This requirement made me create my own code testing tool, <strong>PHPExecute<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>PHPExecute is the fastest way to test PHP code. You write the code, hit the execute button, an ajax request is triggered and you see the output fast without page refresh. Here are some of the cool things about it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Very fast way to test your code<\/li>\n<li>Nice friendly interface<\/li>\n<li>Code  Highlighting<\/li>\n<li>Useful PHP, system information panel<\/li>\n<li>Saving favorite code snippets<\/li>\n<li>Adding useful classes<\/li>\n<li>Easy to extend as per your needs<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Screenshot<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/codeinphp.github.io\/images\/1428864689552abeb12a929.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Extending PHPExecute<\/h2>\n<p>The good thing is that you can download (see below) it, see its source code and extend it however you like according to your needs. For example, you can add classes for testing, performance or any other purpose. One can even integrate bash commands (I am not going into details of that) to make it even more useful tool to work with.<\/p>\n<h2>Usage Notes<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>PHPExecute uses <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/function.eval.php\"><code>eval<\/code><\/a> function to run the code. It is strongly recommended that you should use that tool for local testing only and not on production server due to security reasons. If you do, you use it on your own risk.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>In order to save snippets, PHPExecute uses <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Web_Storage\">localStorage<\/a> feature which is available in latest browsers (and IE9+) only and also it can be around <strong>5MB<\/strong> in size. This isn\u2019t that ideal if you are going to save a lot of snippets but you can always extend PHPExecute to add database support and save your snippets there.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>The custom functions that can be used in PHPExecute can be found in <strong>includes\/functions.php<\/strong> file. You can add any functions in that file that you want to use directly inside PHPExecute. The custom functions can also be seen in <strong>PHP Info &gt; User Defined Functions<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<p><strong>Download<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sarfraznawaz2005\/PHPExecute\">Download PHPExecute at Github<\/a><\/p>\n<p>I hope PHPExecute turns out to be a useful tool for you. Please do share if you add anything to it via comments so that we could know it and integrate ourselves too :)<\/p>",
