<title>Welcome !</title>
<description><p><strong>Hello, World !</strong></p>
<p>This is my first post on this blog hosted at awesome <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>. Previously I used to blog on wordpress <a href="http://sarfraznawaz.wordpress.com">here</a> but I switched to github pages because I really wanted to have static blog with free hosting and ability to write up quick posts using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> syntax. In the next post, I will write about <strong>BloggerCMS</strong>, a CMS I have made that helps create static blogs. This blog has also been generated via BloggerCMS :)</p>
<p>On this blog, I intend to write my ideas mainly about PHP as well as other related web development technologies. </p>
<p><em>Stay tuned :)</em></p></description>
